## MTX Token — Tokenomics

### Initial liquidity:

**92.** Confirm: 1% of supply deposited to DEX at $0.50 initial price on Uniswap v4 (Ethereum).

    **Confirmed:** We will deposit 1% of the total MTX token supply to Uniswap v4 on Ethereum at an initial price of $0.50 per token. This initial liquidity provision ensures:

    - **Fair Launch:** Establishes a transparent and accessible entry point for early adopters
    - **Price Discovery:** Allows market forces to determine the true value of MTX tokens
    - **Liquidity Depth:** Provides sufficient liquidity for initial trading activities
    - **Decentralized Trading:** Leverages Uniswap v4's advanced features for optimal trading experience
    - **Ethereum Network:** Utilizes the most established and secure blockchain for token trading

    This approach demonstrates our commitment to a fair and transparent token launch while providing immediate trading opportunities for the community.

**93.** Initial market cap and FDV implications.

    **Initial Market Cap:** $5M (1% of 1B supply at $0.50 per token) with immediate trading liquidity and price discovery.
    
    **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** $500M based on total supply of 1B tokens at $0.50 initial price, representing conservative valuation for mass adoption potential.
    
    **Market Implications:** Low initial market cap enables organic growth, while FDV provides long-term value proposition for institutional and retail investors.

### Emissions/unlock:

**94.** Confirm: daily 0.3% of total supply "unfrozen" to Matrix Foundation.

    **Confirmed:** We will implement a daily unfreezing mechanism where 0.3% of the total MTX token supply is released to the Matrix Foundation each day. This mechanism ensures:

    - **Controlled Release:** Gradual token distribution prevents market flooding and maintains price stability
    - **Operational Funding:** Provides consistent funding for Matrix Foundation operations, development, and ecosystem growth
    - **Transparency:** Daily releases are publicly verifiable and predictable for the community
    - **Flexibility:** The Foundation can strategically allocate unfrozen tokens for partnerships, development, and community incentives
    - **Long-term Sustainability:** Ensures continuous funding for the project's growth and maintenance over time

    This approach balances the need for operational funding with market stability, demonstrating our commitment to responsible tokenomics and long-term project sustainability.

**95.** Define "freeze/refreeze" mechanics (on-chain vesting? timelock? CEO discretion boundaries?).

    **Freeze Mechanics:** On-chain timelock contracts with 30-day minimum freeze period, requiring 3-of-5 multisig approval for any freeze operations.
    
    **Refreeze Mechanics:** Automatic refreezing after 24 hours if no action taken, with governance override capability and emergency unfreezing for critical situations.
    
    **CEO Discretion:** Limited to emergency situations only, with 48-hour governance review period and automatic reversal if not approved by community vote.

**96.** Clear policy for selling to fund ops vs. refreezing; transparency and reporting cadence.

    **Selling Policy:** Maximum 20% of unfrozen tokens can be sold monthly for operations, with governance approval required for amounts exceeding $100K.
    
    **Refreezing Policy:** Automatic refreezing of unused tokens after 7 days, with quarterly review of operational needs and token utilization.
    
    **Transparency:** Weekly public reports on token movements, monthly financial statements, and quarterly detailed treasury reports with on-chain verification.

### Allocations:

**97.** Foundation, ecosystem, community, team, advisors, market making, reserves.

    The MTX token allocation is structured to ensure long-term sustainability and community growth:

    - **Foundation:** 40% - For operational funding, development, partnerships, and ecosystem growth
    - **Community:** 25% - For user incentives, rewards, airdrops, and community-driven initiatives
    - **Team & Advisors:** 15% - For core team members and strategic advisors with vesting schedules

    - **Anti-Dump Protection:** Daily trading limits and cooling-off periods for large holders
    - **Governance Oversight:** Community voting required for any significant token releases or policy changes

    These mechanisms protect against market manipulation while ensuring tokens are released responsibly to support ecosystem growth and development.

### Treasury and reserves:

**99.** Insurance account vs. profit account definitions, controls, signers, auditability.

    We maintain separate treasury accounts with clear definitions and controls:

    - **Insurance Account:** 2% of total supply reserved for user protection, covering potential losses from smart contract bugs, bridge failures, or security incidents
    - **Profit Account:** Generated from platform fees, swap spreads, and other revenue streams, used for operational expenses and token buybacks
    - **Multi-Signature Control:** Both accounts require 3-of-5 multisig approval from designated signers (CEO, CTO, CFO, and 2 independent board members)
    - **Transparency:** Monthly public reports on account balances, transactions, and fund utilization
    - **Auditability:** All transactions are on-chain and subject to quarterly third-party audits
    - **Governance Oversight:** Major fund movements require community governance approval
    - **Emergency Procedures:** Clear protocols for accessing insurance funds during critical situations

    This structure ensures proper fund management while maintaining transparency and community oversight over treasury operations.

### Staking and rewards:

**100.** Reward source (revenue share vs. emissions), distribution frequency (block/weekly/monthly).

    Our staking rewards system combines revenue sharing with controlled emissions for sustainable long-term incentives:

    - **Revenue Share:** 60% of platform revenue (swap fees, premium features, partnerships) distributed to stakers
    - **Emission Rewards:** 40% from controlled token emissions to ensure consistent rewards during early growth phases
    - **Distribution Frequency:** Weekly distributions every Friday to provide predictable reward schedules
    - **APR Range:** 8-15% annual percentage rate based on staking duration and platform performance
    - **Compound Rewards:** Automatic compounding option available for enhanced long-term returns
    - **Performance-Based:** Higher rewards during periods of increased platform usage and revenue
    - **Governance Integration:** Stakers receive additional governance voting power proportional to their stake

    This hybrid approach ensures sustainable rewards while aligning staker incentives with platform success and long-term growth.

**101.** Eligibility (stakers only vs. all holders), snapshot mechanism, slashing conditions if any.

    Our staking system is designed to be inclusive while maintaining security and performance:

    - **Eligibility:** All MTX token holders can participate in staking with a minimum threshold of 1,000 MTX tokens
    - **Snapshot Mechanism:** Weekly snapshots taken every Friday at 12:00 UTC to determine reward eligibility
    - **Staking Periods:** Flexible staking options from 30 days to 2 years with increasing rewards for longer commitments
    - **No Slashing:** We do not implement slashing conditions to encourage participation and reduce risk for users
    - **Early Unstaking:** Available with reduced rewards (50% penalty) to maintain system stability
    - **Governance Rights:** All stakers receive proportional voting power in governance decisions
    - **Reward Calculation:** Based on average stake balance during the staking period for fair distribution

    This approach encourages broad participation while maintaining system security through reasonable minimum thresholds and flexible staking terms.

### Buybacks and burns:

**102.** Triggers (revenue thresholds, governance votes), execution rules.

    Our buyback and burn mechanism is designed to create deflationary pressure and support token value:

    - **Revenue Threshold Triggers:** Automatic buybacks when monthly revenue exceeds $1M, using 20% of excess revenue
    - **Governance-Initiated Burns:** Community can vote to burn tokens from treasury reserves during high-revenue periods
    - **Quarterly Burns:** Scheduled burns of 0.5% of total supply every quarter if platform performance targets are met
    - **Fee-Based Burns:** 10% of all platform fees are automatically used for token buybacks and burns
    - **Execution Rules:** All buybacks executed through DEX aggregators for optimal pricing and minimal market impact
    - **Transparency:** Public announcements 48 hours before major burn events with detailed reporting
    - **Emergency Pause:** Governance can pause buyback mechanisms during extreme market conditions

    This multi-layered approach ensures consistent token deflation while maintaining flexibility for different market conditions and community needs.

### Compliance:

**103.** Security vs. utility token stance, jurisdictions, offering status, KYC requirements.

    **Token Classification:** Utility token with clear use cases (gas sponsorship, governance, premium features) and no expectation of profit from token appreciation.
    
    **Jurisdictions:** Available in 180+ countries with compliance in major jurisdictions (US, EU, Singapore, UK) and ongoing regulatory monitoring.
    
    **Offering Status:** Private sale to accredited investors, public launch through DEX listing, with no public offering or securities registration.
